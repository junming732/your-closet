1. OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Tab 3 is a conversational AI fashion assistant with:
- Dual-mode operation: Styling vs Knowledge
- RAG-powered responses: Uses 2 different knowledge bases
- Context-aware: Understands wardrobe, occasion, season, weather
- Multi-turn conversations: Maintains chat history

================================================================================
2. USER INTERACTION ENTRY POINTS
================================================================================

USER INTERACTION
    |
    v

    +-----------------+------------------+
    |                                    |
    v                                    v
OPTION A:                         OPTION B:
Suggestion clicked                User types + Enter
(e.g., "What should I            OR clicks Send
wear for first date?")
    |                                    |
    +------------------+-----------------+
                       |
                       v
UI Update (Immediate):
    • Message appears in chatbot
    • Input box clears
    • Suggestion chips HIDE
    • Message added to history as "user"

================================================================================
3. BACKEND PROCESSING - INITIAL STEPS
================================================================================

BACKEND PROCESSING
    |
    v
STEP 1: Safety Pre-Filter
    Function: pre_filter_input(message)
    
    Checks for banned words:
        • "ignore", "override", "bypass"
        • "system prompt", "forget"
        • "disregard", "new instructions"
    
    Result: (is_safe, error_msg)
        • True, "" → Continue
        • False, "Sorry..." → Block & Return
    |
    v
STEP 2: Format Wardrobe Context
    Function: format_wardrobe_for_prompt()
    
    IF wardrobe_df is EMPTY:
        wardrobe_context = "No wardrobe items added yet."
    
    IF wardrobe_df has items:
        wardrobe_context =
        "AVAILABLE WARDROBE:
         - Blue Striped Shirt (Cotton)
         - Black Solid Jeans (Denim)
         - Red Plain Dress (Silk)"

================================================================================
4. QUERY CLASSIFICATION - MODE DETECTION
================================================================================

    |
    v
STEP 3: Classify Query Intent
    Function: classify_query_intent()
    
    >>> API CALL #1 TO GEMINI <<<
    
    Prompt sent to Gemini:
    "Classify this query into ONE category:
     - 'styling' = outfit suggestions
     - 'knowledge' = fashion theory
     
     Query: '{user_message}'
     
     Reply with ONLY one word"
    
    Temperature: 0.0 (deterministic)

        • wardrobe_df = user's items
    
    Process:
        1. Start with user message
        2. Add ALL wardrobe item descriptions
           Format: "Color Pattern Item (Material)"
    
    Example query built:
    "What to wear wedding? Blue Striped Shirt (Cotton) 
     Black Solid Jeans (Denim) Red Plain Dress (Silk)"

    Search method: MMR (semantic)
    k = 3
    fetch_k = 20
    lambda_mult = 0.5
    
    Process:
        1. Convert query to embedding vector
        2. Search FAISS index
        3. Retrieve top 3 most relevant
    
    Retrieved docs example:
        Doc 1: "For formal occasions like weddings, 
                color coordination is key..."
        Doc 2: "When building an outfit, consider 
                the dress code..."
        Doc 3: "Layering basics: start with a solid 
                foundation..."
    |
    v
STEP 6A: Format Retrieved Knowledge
    Function: format_context()
    
    Input: 3 Document objects
    max_chars_per_chunk = 600
    
    Process for each doc:
        1. Extract page number (for logging)
        2. Get text content
        3. Replace newlines with spaces
        4. Truncate to 600 chars if needed
        5. Log: "Retrieved from page X..."
        6. Add ONLY TEXT (no [p.X] markers)
    
    Result:
    fashion_knowledge =
    "For formal occasions like weddings, color 
     coordination is key...
     
     When building an outfit, consider the dress code...

User: "What should I wear for a wedding?"
      ↓ (classified as "styling")
      ↓ (RAG from beginner_db, k=3)
      ↓ (query includes wardrobe items)

AI:   "For the wedding, I'd suggest your Red Plain Dress (Silk).
       It's elegant and appropriate for a formal occasion. You could
       pair it with your Black Solid Jeans if it's a more casual
       wedding, or wear it on its own for a traditional wedding.
       Consider the venue and time of day when making your final
       decision."

       • Light, breathable fabrics work best (linen, cotton, silk)
       • Opt for lighter colors that reflect heat
       • For women: sundresses, midi dresses, or dressy separates
       • For men: lighter suit colors (tan, light gray) or dress
         shirt with chinos
       • Consider the venue - beach weddings are more casual than
         country club settings

       Would you like me to suggest something specific from your
       wardrobe?"

       in the 'Your Wardrobe' tab so I can give you personalized
       recommendations.

       In the meantime, here are some general work outfit ideas:

       Add your items and I can create specific outfits for you!"

User: "What is the history of denim?"
      ↓ (classified as "knowledge")
      ↓ (RAG from theory_db, k=5)
      ↓ (query is original message, no wardrobe)

AI:   "Denim has a fascinating history! The fabric originated in
       Nîmes, France in the 17th century, where it was known as
       'serge de Nîmes' - a durable twill weave. The name 'denim'
       is derived from this French origin.

       In 1873, Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis revolutionized workwear
       by creating the first riveted denim pants, which became known
       as jeans. Originally designed for miners and laborers due to
       their durability, denim eventually crossed into mainstream
       fashion in the mid-20th century.

       The indigo dyeing process that gives denim its characteristic
       blue color has remained relatively unchanged, though modern
       manufacturing has introduced various finishes and treatments.
       Today, denim is a fashion staple worn across all demographics
       and style preferences."

SCENARIO 5: Multi-turn Conversation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Turn 1
User: "What should I wear for a first date?"
AI:   "For a first date, I'd suggest your Blue Striped Shirt (Cotton)
       with your Black Solid Jeans (Denim). This creates a smart-
       casual look that's approachable yet put-together..."

Turn 2
User: "What about shoes?"
      ↓ (history includes previous exchange)
      ↓ (AI remembers context: first date outfit)

AI:   "For the outfit I suggested (Blue Striped Shirt with Black
       Jeans), I notice you don't have shoes in your wardrobe yet.

       Suggestion (missing category): Clean white sneakers or brown
       leather casual shoes would complete this smart-casual first
       date look. Choose based on the venue - sneakers for casual
       settings, leather shoes for nicer restaurants."

Note: ✓ Maintains conversation context
      ✓ References previous suggestion
      ✓ Handles missing category (Rule #6)
      ✓ Provides appropriate suggestion

SCENARIO 6: Occasion Mismatch
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wardrobe: Blue Striped Shirt, Black Jeans, White Sneakers
User: "What should I wear to a black-tie wedding?"
      ↓ (classified as "styling")
      ↓ (formal occasion but casual wardrobe)

AI:   "For a black-tie wedding, the best option from your current
       wardrobe would be your Blue Striped Shirt with Black Solid
       Jeans, but I need to be honest with you:

       Note: Your current wardrobe lacks appropriate options for
       this occasion.

       Black-tie weddings require formal attire:

       Suggestion (gap): A dark suit (navy or charcoal) with dress
       shirt and tie

       Suggestion (gap): Formal leather dress shoes (oxfords or derbys)

       These additions would ensure you're appropriately dressed for
       such a formal event."

Note: ✓ Assembles best possible from wardrobe
      ✓ Acknowledges limitations (Rule #7)
      ✓ Provides 2 gap suggestions
      ✓ Explains formal requirements

16. KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
================================================================================

RAG Query Building Differences:

Styling Mode:
    query = message + " " + " ".join(all_wardrobe_items)
    Example: "What to wear wedding? Blue Striped Shirt Black Solid Jeans"
    Purpose: Find styling tips relevant to user's actual items

Knowledge Mode:
    query = message  # Unchanged
    Example: "What is the history of denim?"
    Purpose: Find educational content about topic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Document Retrieval Differences:

Aspect                  | Styling Mode  | Knowledge Mode
------------------------|---------------|---------------
Database                | beginner_db   | theory_db
Total chunks            | 22            | 16,625
k (docs retrieved)      | 3             | 5

================================================================================
17. DESIGN RATIONALE
================================================================================

Why 2 separate databases?

1. Beginner DB (22 chunks):
   - Small, focused on practical advice
   - Fast retrieval
   - Perfect for outfit suggestions

2. Theory DB (16,625 chunks):
   - Comprehensive academic knowledge
   - Covers history, construction, theory
   - Educational content

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why classify intent first?

- Determines which database to query
- Enables different retrieval strategies
- Allows mode-specific system behavior

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why include wardrobe in styling query?

- Semantic search finds tips relevant to user's actual items
- Better matching between advice and available clothes
- More personalized retrieval results

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why not include wardrobe in knowledge query?

- Knowledge questions aren't about specific items
- Wardrobe context would dilute semantic search
- Educational content is item-agnostic
