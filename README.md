# üëó Gemini Closet RAG ‚Äî Group Project

This repository contains our team‚Äôs work for the ‚ÄúFashion Stylist Assistant‚Äù assignment.

---

## Original Team Work (Unmodified)

To keep this repo clear for reviewers, **all teammates‚Äô raw contributions are preserved unchanged** in
[`original_contributions/`](original_contributions/).
This folder includes Maria‚Äôs Gradio wardrobe app, Dafne‚Äôs Gemini RAG notebook, and all uploaded PDFs.

All production-ready, integrated code now lives in the [`src/`](src/) directory.
Our `src` code uses Maria‚Äôs wardrobe logic + Dafne‚Äôs retrieval logic, with a unified UI.

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
