## Building & Updating the Fashion Theory RAG Index

The **Fashion Theory Q&A** feature uses a small set of public-domain fashion texts stored in the `open_fashion_texts/` folder.
Before running the app for the first time (or after adding/removing documents), you must (re)build the FAISS index:

```bash
# from the project root
python -m src.scripts.build_fashion_theory_index
```

This script will:

- Load all PDFs and TXT files from `open_fashion_texts/`
- Chunk and embed them with Gemini
- Save the FAISS index to `faiss_index/fashion_theory/`

YOnly need to run this script again when you add, remove, or update documents.
The Gradio app then automatically loads the updated index at startup:

```bash
python -m src.app.main
```

Gradio will start on **http://localhost:7861**.

- **Wardrobe Management** ‚Äì Add, edit, delete, upload, or export your clothing items.
- **Build Outfit** ‚Äì Combines your wardrobe items with style tips retrieved from our PDF knowledge base using Gemini.
- **Chat with Stylist** ‚Äì Ask free-form styling questions, powered by Fashion Theory RAG index.
